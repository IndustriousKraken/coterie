## Notes

- **Current Status**: All core repositories implemented, authentication complete, ready for API handlers and testing
- **Next Step**: Create database seeding script, implement remaining API handlers, add integration tests
- **Blocking Issues**: None currently
- **Dependencies**: Need to evaluate specific Discord and Unifi API libraries
- **Completed Today**: 
  - ✅ SQLite Member Repository with full CRUD
  - ✅ SQLite Event Repository with attendance tracking
  - ✅ SQLite Announcement Repository with visibility control
  - ✅ SQLite Payment Repository with status management
  - ✅ Authentication system with sessions
  - ✅ Password hashing with Argon2id
  - ✅ Auth middleware (require_auth, require_admin)
  - ✅ Member management API handlers
  - ✅ Integration tests for member repository
  - ✅ All repositories now fully implemented and compiling
  - ✅ Database seeding script with test data

## Quick Start Tasks

For getting a minimal viable product running:

1. Implement member repository with SQLite
2. Add basic authentication (no 2FA initially)
3. Create simple HTMX admin interface for member management
4. Add Stripe webhook handler for payment processing
5. Deploy to a VPS with SQLite and Caddy
