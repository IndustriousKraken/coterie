# Changelog

All notable changes to Coterie are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file is the **source of truth for release bodies**: the release workflow
publishes the section whose header matches the tag being released (see
`.github/workflows/release.yml`). Once a version's tag is published, its section
is **immutable** — fix mistakes in a later version's notes, never by rewriting a
released section. Only `[Unreleased]` is ever ahead of every tag; everything
under a version header is accurate for that version forever.

<!--
Release convention (performed at release prep by a maintainer / the
autocoder's changelog generator, NOT by ordinary changes):

  1. Rename the `## [Unreleased]` header to `## [vX.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`
     (em-dash, ISO date), keeping its Added/Changed/Fixed entries.
  2. Add a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it.
  3. Commit, THEN tag that commit `vX.Y.Z` — so the tagged commit carries
     its own finalized entry and the release body is sourced from it.

Sections are ordered newest-first. Use the Keep a Changelog subheads:
Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security.
