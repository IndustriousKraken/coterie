Join us for our annual day of service to the wider community! This year we're partnering with local organizations to make a meaningful impact in several areas around our neighborhood.

Morning teams will be working with Habitat for Humanity on a home renovation project for a family in need. We'll be painting, doing light landscaping, and helping with interior finishing work. No construction experience is necessary—experienced volunteers will guide all tasks. Please wear clothes you don't mind getting dirty.

Our food pantry team will be sorting and organizing donations at the Regional Food Bank, followed by preparing meal boxes for homebound seniors through the Meals on Wheels program. This is a great opportunity for families with children to participate together.

The environmental crew will be cleaning up Miller Creek Park and planting native species along the waterway. The Parks Department is providing all tools and materials, and their naturalist will give a brief talk about local ecology during our lunch break.

We'll gather for a simple lunch at noon (provided by the hospitality committee), share stories of the morning's work, and then continue with afternoon projects. Childcare is available at the fellowship hall for children under 5.

Sign up in the narthex or through the member portal to indicate which project interests you. Carpooling will be arranged for off-site locations. All ages and abilities welcome—there are meaningful tasks for everyone!"""

We are honored to host an evening of interfaith conversation and connection with leaders and members from neighboring faith communities. This gathering reflects our commitment to understanding, respect, and cooperation across religious traditions.

Our panel will include Rabbi Sarah Goldstein from Temple Beth Shalom, Imam Ahmed Hassan from the Islamic Center, Rev. Dr. Patricia Williams from Grace AME Church, and Dharma Teacher Michael Lee from the Zen Center. Each will offer brief reflections on how their tradition approaches themes of community, compassion, and service.

Following the panel, we'll break into small mixed groups for facilitated conversations around shared tables. Prompts will explore common ground: How do our traditions teach us to care for neighbors? What spiritual practices sustain us in difficult times? How can we work together on issues affecting our city?

A light reception with refreshments from various culinary traditions will follow. Several of our members have volunteered to prepare dishes representing their cultural heritage, and our guests are bringing contributions as well.

This event grows out of relationships built over years of cooperation—joint Thanksgiving services, shared disaster relief efforts, and ongoing social justice partnerships. We hope it deepens those bonds and welcomes newcomers into the circle of mutual respect.

Middle and high school youth are invited to an overnight adventure at the church! Drop-off is at 7 PM Friday, pickup at 9 AM Saturday morning. Get ready for a night of fun, faith, and maybe a little bit of not-sleeping.

The evening kicks off with a pizza party and our famous "chaos games" in the fellowship hall—capture the flag, sardines, and the legendary gaga ball tournament. Wear comfortable clothes and shoes you can run in (no flip-flops, please).

Around 10 PM we'll transition to our theme for the night: "Who Am I? Identity in Faith." Through interactive activities, small group discussions, and creative expression, we'll explore questions of identity, belonging, and purpose. How do faith and values shape who we're becoming? How do we stay true to ourselves while navigating peer pressure and social expectations?

Midnight snacks and a movie follow (we'll vote on options—keep it PG-13 or below). For those who actually want to sleep, quiet spaces will be available starting around 1 AM. Early birds can expect sunrise yoga on the lawn, weather permitting.

We'll close with a simple breakfast prepared by parent volunteers and a morning devotion in the chapel.

What to bring: sleeping bag, pillow, toiletries, change of clothes, any medications, and a signed permission form (available on the youth page or from the office). Cost is $15 to cover food and supplies; scholarships available—just ask.

Adult chaperones (background checked) will be present throughout. Contact Youth Director Jamie for questions."""

Our ongoing Wednesday evening study continues with a deep dive into Ecclesiastes, often considered the most philosophical and challenging book in the wisdom tradition. This week we're exploring chapters 3-4, including the famous "a time for everything" passage.

Pastor Rebecca will provide historical context—who might have written this text and why, the Persian-period influences visible in its language and themes, and how ancient readers would have understood its seemingly contradictory messages about meaning and futility.

We'll then break into discussion groups to wrestle with the text ourselves. What does the author mean by "meaningless" (or "vanity" in older translations)? Is this pessimism, realism, or something else entirely? How do these ancient reflections on mortality, injustice, and life's absurdities speak to our contemporary struggles?

Bring your preferred translation; having multiple versions enriches our discussions considerably. Study guides are available from the office for those who want to read ahead.

This group meets weekly and newcomers are always welcome—no prior biblical scholarship required, just curiosity and willingness to engage with challenging ideas. Childcare provided upon request (please let us know by Tuesday).

Staff members will explain the many ways to connect: small groups for every interest and life stage, service opportunities, educational programs, and spiritual practices. We'll tour the building (it's bigger than it looks!) and answer all your questions about how things work.

Most importantly, we want to hear your story. What brings you here? What are you looking for in a faith community? What gifts and passions do you carry? Getting to know each other is what this is really about.

A catered lunch follows the formal program, giving you time to mingle with current members who are eager to meet you. Childcare and children's programming run parallel to the adult orientation.

Attending this orientation carries no obligation—you're welcome to continue discerning whether this is the right community for you. If you do decide to join, we'll celebrate your commitment in an upcoming service.

Pastor David will offer reflections on the sacred bond between humans and animals, our responsibility as caretakers of creation, and the comfort and joy our animal companions bring to our lives. Each animal will receive an individual blessing and a small commemorative medal for their collar or cage.

We've had everything from dogs and cats to hamsters, parakeets, horses (yes, someone brought a horse), and even a pot-bellied pig named Hamilton. Fish and other aquatic pets can come in their travel tanks. Photos of deceased pets are also welcome for a blessing of remembrance.

For safety, all dogs must be leashed and cats or small animals must be in carriers or on harnesses. If your pet doesn't do well with crowds or other animals, we can arrange a private blessing—just contact the office.

We'll have treats for both pets and humans, a blessing station for photos, and information from the local animal shelter about volunteer opportunities and animals seeking homes. Donations of pet food and supplies will be collected for the community pet food bank.

Agenda items include: review of current year-to-date income and expenses versus budget, update on the capital campaign for roof replacement, investment portfolio performance report from our advisor, and discussion of stewardship campaign strategies for the pledge drive.

Treasurer Thompson will present the quarterly report and year-end projections. We're currently running slightly under budget on pledges (typical for this time of year) but ahead on facility rental income due to several new regular renters.

The roof project bids came in higher than our initial estimates, and we'll need to discuss options: adjusting scope, extending timeline, or additional fundraising. Building Committee Chair Martinez will join us to explain the proposals.

As we look toward budget planning, we're seeking input on ministry priorities. What programs deserve additional resources? Where might we find efficiencies? Committee members are asked to gather feedback from their circles before the meeting.

Our annual ecumenical Thanksgiving service brought together members from seven different faith communities for an evening of gratitude, music, and reflection. This cherished tradition goes back over forty years to when three neighborhood churches decided to celebrate together.

This year's service was hosted by our congregation, with Rev. Thomas Morrison from First Presbyterian delivering the homily on "Gratitude in Difficult Times." The combined choir, featuring singers from all participating congregations, performed three pieces including a stunning arrangement of "Now Thank We All Our God" and a contemporary piece by Alice Parker.

Representatives from each tradition offered prayers of thanksgiving in the styles of their communities—from formal liturgy to spontaneous praise, from silent meditation to call-and-response. The diversity of expression reminded us how many paths lead to gratitude.

Following the service, attendees gathered in the fellowship hall for a dessert reception. Many families have made this an annual tradition—we saw grandparents who remember the first services bringing their grandchildren to continue the legacy.

A special collection raised over $3,500 for the community food bank, which reports unprecedented demand this year. Many attendees also brought canned goods and non-perishables.

We gathered to celebrate the life of Helen Marie Morrison (1938-2024), a beloved member of our congregation for over fifty years. Helen passed peacefully at home on October 28th, surrounded by family and the prayers of her church community.

Helen served this congregation in countless ways: as Sunday School teacher for thirty years, choir member, women's guild president, and tireless volunteer wherever needed. Many adults in our congregation can trace their early faith formation to "Miss Helen's" third-grade class, where she combined biblical storytelling with craft projects and seemingly endless patience.

The service included reflections from Pastor David, who shared memories from his weekly visits during Helen's final months, and from Helen's daughter Margaret, who spoke about growing up with a mother whose faith was lived daily, not just proclaimed. The choir sang "Amazing Grace" and "In the Garden"—two of Helen's favorites.

Following the service, the family received visitors in the fellowship hall, where photo boards displayed Helen's life from her rural Iowa childhood through her decades in our community. Stories were shared, tears were shed and wiped away, and her famous lemon bars (made from her recipe by the hospitality committee) were enjoyed one more time.

This week's focus: movements 3-5, including the challenging "Gloria" with its shifting time signatures and divisi passages. Sopranos, be ready for that high A. Tenors, we'll work on the fugal entrance in movement 4.

Instrumentalists: strings and brass rehearsal schedule is now posted in the music office. Piano and organ run-through with the choir is scheduled for December 15th.

While we work, we'll discuss the history and symbolism of the Advent wreath: why four candles? What do the colors represent? How can lighting the wreath become a meaningful family practice rather than just decoration? Take-home devotional guides will be provided.

This event works well for all ages—children love working with the fragrant greens (supervised, of course, away from the candle flame!), and the finished wreaths make wonderful family centerpieces.

Cost is $20 per wreath to cover materials; scholarships available as always. Please register in advance so we can order sufficient supplies. If you're joining us, bring pruning shears if you have them (we'll have some to share).

Coffee, cider, and homemade cookies will be served. Festive music will be playing. Ugly Christmas sweaters optional but appreciated.

As we approach the season of Thanksgiving, we invite you to prayerfully consider your commitment to our congregation for the coming year. Your pledges make possible everything we do together—from worship and education to fellowship and outreach.

This year's theme, "Grateful Hearts, Generous Hands," reflects our belief that giving flows naturally from gratitude. When we pause to recognize the blessings in our lives—family, community, purpose, hope—generosity becomes not an obligation but a joy.

Our proposed budget for the coming year is $485,000, representing a modest 3% increase to account for cost-of-living adjustments for staff, utilities increases, and one new part-time position in youth ministry. This budget maintains all current programming while investing in our future.

Pledge Sunday is November 17th. You'll receive pledge materials in the mail this week, or you can complete your pledge online through the member portal. We ask that everyone prayerfully consider their commitment—whatever amount represents your grateful response. Every pledge matters, regardless of size.

Under his ministry, our congregation grew from 150 to over 400 active members.

Thank you for your tremendous response to our "Raise the Roof" capital campaign! We're excited to report that we've reached 78% of our $180,000 goal, with $140,400 in pledges and gifts received.

After reviewing three contractor proposals, the Building Committee has selected Paramount Roofing for the project. They offered the best combination of experience, references, materials quality, and value. Work is tentatively scheduled to begin in late spring, weather permitting.

The project scope includes complete replacement of the sanctuary and education wing roofs, new gutters and downspouts, and improved attic ventilation. We're also taking this opportunity to add solar-ready infrastructure, positioning us for a potential future solar installation grant application.

What you'll notice during construction: Some parking disruption, possible noise during worship (we're scheduling around our service times as much as possible), and temporary protective walkways. The sanctuary will remain accessible throughout.

We're still $39,600 short of our goal. If you haven't yet made a pledge, please consider contributing. Payment plans are available, and gifts of any size help. Many members have asked about naming opportunities; contact the church office if interested.

It is with heavy hearts and deep gratitude for a life well-lived that we announce the passing of Helen Marie Morrison on October 28th. Helen was 86 years old and had been a faithful member of our congregation for over fifty years.

Helen was born in rural Iowa to farming parents who instilled in her a deep faith and a fierce work ethic. She met her beloved husband Charles at a church picnic in 1958; they were married for 54 years until his passing in 2012. Together they raised three children: Margaret (David) Chen, Robert (deceased), and Thomas (Jennifer) Morrison. She was grandmother to seven and great-grandmother to three, with one more on the way.

Helen's decades of service to our congregation are legendary. She taught third-grade Sunday School for thirty years, shaping the faith of hundreds of children. She sang in the choir, organized countless potlucks and funeral dinners, served on the women's guild board, and was always among the first to volunteer when help was needed.

But Helen will be most remembered for her warmth, her ever-present smile, and her gift for making everyone feel valued. She remembered names and stories, asked thoughtful questions, and listened with genuine interest. At her request, her memorial service was a celebration of the community she loved, filled with music, laughter, and lemon bars made from her secret recipe.

A memorial fund has been established in Helen's name to support the Sunday School program. Cards for the family may be sent to the church office.
