description = """
Join us for an immersive, hands-on workshop where we'll bring a piece of computing history back to life. We've acquired a non-functional TRS-80 Model I from 1977, and over the course of this extended session, we'll diagnose its issues, source replacement components, and hopefully see it boot for the first time in decades.

What we'll cover:
- Visual inspection and damage assessment of vintage hardware
- Using period-appropriate test equipment (oscilloscopes, logic probes)
- Troubleshooting the Z80 CPU and associated support chips
- Capacitor replacement and power supply restoration
- Keyboard matrix debugging and contact cleaning
- Video output calibration for composite monitors

Participants should bring:
- Basic soldering equipment (stations available for those who need them)
- ESD-safe work practices (wrist straps provided)
- Patience and a willingness to learn from failure

This workshop is limited to 12 participants to ensure everyone gets hands-on time with the hardware. Prior experience with vintage computing is helpful but not required—enthusiasm counts for more than expertise here.

Refreshments will be provided, including period-appropriate snacks (Tang, anyone?). We'll also have documentation from the original Radio Shack technical manuals available for reference.

Whether we succeed or fail, we'll learn something valuable about the engineering decisions of the late 1970s and why these machines were revolutionary for their time."""

Challenge categories include:
- SQL injection (from basic UNION attacks to blind boolean-based extraction)
- Cross-site scripting (reflected, stored, and DOM-based variants)
- Authentication bypass techniques
- Insecure direct object references
- Server-side request forgery
- XML external entity attacks

The environment will remain available for a week after the event for those who want to continue working on challenges they didn't complete.

Beginners are welcome! We'll have mentors available to provide hints and explain concepts. Bring your laptop with Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP installed. A Kali VM is recommended but not required.

- Written a playable game entirely in assembly
- Understood how the Z80 addresses memory and handles I/O
- Learned debugging techniques for bare-metal programming
- Gained appreciation for what game developers accomplished with 4KB of RAM

We'll be building a simple but complete "Snake" clone, covering:
- Setting up the development environment (cross-assemblers on modern hardware)
- Memory maps and the TRS-80 video display system
- Keyboard scanning and input handling
- Game loop architecture without an operating system
- Sprite-like graphics using character cell manipulation
- Sound generation through the cassette port
- High score persistence to memory

Lunch break included (bring your own or there are restaurants nearby). We'll work in pairs, so this is a great opportunity to meet other members interested in low-level programming.

We're thrilled to announce the launch of our new member portal! After months of development (and more than a few late-night debugging sessions), we finally have a modern way to manage club activities.

What you can do with the new portal:
- View and RSVP to upcoming events
- Update your membership information
- See announcements without checking your email
- Track your membership status and payment history

For those who remember the old system (a spreadsheet, a mailing list, and prayer), this is a significant upgrade. We've tried to keep things simple while adding the features members have been requesting.

If you encounter any bugs or have feature requests, please let an admin know. This system is itself a club project, and contributions are welcome! The code is open source and available on our GitHub.

Your existing login credentials should work. If you have trouble accessing your account, use the password reset function or grab any board member at the next meeting.

Huge congratulations to our CTF team for their performance in last weekend's HackTheBox University CTF! Out of over 1,200 teams worldwide, HEHC finished in 87th place—our best showing ever in an international competition.

Special recognition goes to:
- Alice for solving three of the four pwn challenges, including the brutal "kernel_nightmare" that only 45 teams completed
- Bob and Charlie for their relentless work on the web challenges, including a creative unintended solution that the organizers have since patched
- The forensics crew for their 4am breakthrough on the memory dump analysis challenge
- Everyone who stayed up way too late, ate too much pizza, and had way too much fun

For those curious about the challenges, we'll be doing a writeup presentation at next month's meeting where team members will walk through their solutions. It's a great learning opportunity even if you're new to CTFs.

This result qualifies us for direct entry into two upcoming invite-only events. More details to come as we confirm participation.

The new access control system is now live! If you haven't picked up your new key fob yet, please see a board member at the next meeting or during open hours.

- Session 3: RAM and memory mapping
- Session 4: The 6522 VIA for I/O
- Session 5: Video output (composite or VGA, your choice)
- Session 6: Keyboard input and tying it all together

Materials cost: approximately $50-75 depending on options. We've negotiated a group buy for the more expensive components.

Prerequisites: basic soldering ability and patience. No prior electronics experience required—we'll explain everything as we go.

Space is limited to 15 participants due to equipment and mentorship constraints. Registration opens next week. Past workshop attendees get priority for the first 48 hours.
