Our popular monthly teaching game session where stronger players provide instruction through actual gameplay. This is one of the best ways to improve—there's no substitute for having a stronger player explain their thinking during a real game.

How it works:
- Players 10-kyu and below are paired with players 3-dan and above
- Games are played at an appropriate handicap
- The stronger player thinks aloud, explaining key moves and concepts
- Games may be paused for discussion of important positions
- Each game is followed by a 10-15 minute review

This month's focus: Middle game fighting and direction of play. Our teachers will emphasize recognizing when to fight, when to take territory, and how to evaluate whole-board position.

Registration is required and limited to 12 students per session to ensure quality instruction. Please indicate your current rank when signing up so we can arrange appropriate pairings.

Teachers this month:
- Tanaka Hiroshi (5-dan)
- Chen Wei (4-dan)
- Park Min-jun (4-dan)
- Lisa Anderson (3-dan)

Continuing our study of historically significant games, this month we examine the groundbreaking 2016 match between Lee Sedol and DeepMind's AlphaGo. Even years later, these games continue to offer profound insights into the nature of Go.

This session focuses on Game 4—the famous game where Lee Sedol found the "divine move" at move 78, the wedge that even AlphaGo's creators said the AI gave only a 1-in-10,000 chance of being played. Understanding why this move worked reveals deep truths about shape, potential, and the limits of pattern recognition.

We'll examine:
- The early game patterns that were revolutionary at the time but are now standard
- White's approach to the center moyo and the critical timing of invasions
- The famous move 78 and why it's considered one of the greatest moves ever played
- AlphaGo's response and why the machine struggled to recover
- How this game influenced professional play worldwide

Materials provided: SGF files for self-study, game commentary from multiple professional sources.

This is an intermediate-to-advanced study session. Players should be comfortable with basic tesujis and life-and-death problems. Even if some discussions go over your head, exposure to high-level analysis is valuable at any rank.

Never played Go before? Curious about this ancient game? This workshop is designed for complete beginners—no experience necessary!

In three hours, you'll learn:
- The basic rules of Go (there are only four!)
- How to capture stones and create territory
- Why this simple game has captivated millions for over 4,000 years
- How to find opponents and continue learning

The workshop is highly interactive. After a brief introduction, you'll play several "capture Go" games on small boards to build intuition. By the end, you'll play your first full game on a 9x9 board with instructor guidance.

Why learn Go?
- It's the oldest board game still played in its original form
- Simple rules create infinite complexity
- Unlike chess, computers only recently became competitive with humans
- It's a lifetime pursuit—there's always more to learn
- The global Go community is welcoming and supportive

After an exciting day of competition, we're thrilled to announce the results of our Winter Championship Tournament!

Final Standings:
1st Place (Club Champion 2024): Kim Soo-young (4-dan)
2nd Place: Tanaka Hiroshi (5-dan)
3rd Place: Park Min-jun (4-dan)
4th Place: Chen Wei (4-dan)

The championship game between Kim and Tanaka was a masterpiece of positional judgment. Despite giving away a small corner early, Kim's superior reading in the middle game created a decisive territorial advantage that Tanaka couldn't overcome. The game was eventually decided by only 3.5 points—a testament to the level of play.

Special recognition:
- Best Game Award: Semifinal between Tanaka and Park, an epic 4-hour battle with multiple ko fights
- Fighting Spirit Award: Maria Santos (3-kyu), who defeated two dan-level opponents before falling in the quarterfinals
- Most Improved: David Chen, who advanced two stones stronger than his seeding predicted
